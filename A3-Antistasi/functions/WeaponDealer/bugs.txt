Bug: Shops not spawning
Description: The shop isn't on the marked location on the map. Multiple locations. Might have something to do with Petros vanishing as well
Reproduction Steps: Leave the server on for an extended period of time 24-30 hours without a soft restart of the map

Bug: Multiple sell boxes
Discription: Multiple sell boxes spawned
Probably related with spawning issues above

Bug: Recruited Squads not getting weapons
Description: Hired Squads do not seem to be spawning in with any weapons even though we have plenty in the arsenal, this means friendly AI cannot defend unless they have statics making it difficult for us to hold things and have to be proactively defending
Reason: HC squads do not have the information to spawn with weapons

Bug: Unlock data is not broadcasted to everyone
Reason: I am stupid and forgot
